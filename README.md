üßë‚Äçüåæ Irrigational Agricultural Land Data Analysis

Project Description: This project focuses on cleaning, processing, and analyzing agricultural irrigation data using Python. It is tailored for deriving insights from district-level data across India, especially focusing on irrigation coverage, holdings by social group, and statistical distributions.

üìã Project Highlights

- **Data Preprocessing**
  - Handled missing values, data types, duplicates, and standardization.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**
  - Visualized distribution, correlations, and group-wise insights using plots.
  
- **Statistical Insights**
  - Performed hypothesis testing (t-test, chi-squared), outlier detection (IQR), and variance inflation factor (VIF) analysis.
  
- **Feature Engineering**
  - Computed metrics like `Proportion irrigated` and grouped summaries.


OBJECTIVES:
1. To perform data cleaning by by replacing placeholders and identifying and handle missing or null values in the dataset.

2. Calculating the proportion of irrigated area relative to total land holdings.

3. To explore irrigation agricultural data through visual analysis using histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, and heatmaps

4. To perform EDA by generating summary statistics, evaluating correlation and covariance, detecting outliers using the IQR method, and analyzing irrigation patterns grouped by district and social group.

5. To conduct statistical and visual analysis of agricultural irrigation data by applying descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing (t-test, chi-square, A/B testing), normality assessment and multicollinearity detection (VIF)
